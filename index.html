        <h3 id="tribute-info">Here's a time line of Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him)</h3>

        <ul id="timeline">
            <li><strong>570 CE:</strong> Muhammad is born in the city of Mecca, in present-day Saudi Arabia.</li>
            <li><strong>610 CE:</strong> At the age of 40, Muhammad receives his first revelation from Allah (God)
                through
                the angel Gabriel while meditating in a cave on Mount Hira. This event marks the beginning of his
                prophethood.
            </li>
            <li><strong>613 CE:</strong> Muhammad starts sharing the message of Islam publicly, inviting people to
                worship
                the one true God and abandon idolatry. His early followers include his wife, Khadijah, and his cousin,
                Ali.
            </li>
            <li><strong>615 CE:</strong> Facing growing opposition from the Quraysh, the dominant tribe in Mecca,
                Muhammad
                permits some of his followers to migrate to the Christian kingdom of Abyssinia (modern-day Ethiopia) to
                seek
                refuge from persecution.</li>
            <li><strong>619 CE:</strong> A year of immense personal loss for Muhammad, as his beloved wife Khadijah and
                his
                uncle Abu Talib both pass away. This period is known as the "Year of Sorrow."</li>
            <li><strong>622 CE:</strong> Recognizing the growing threat to his followers, Muhammad and his followers
                migrate
                from Mecca to the city of Medina (then known as Yathrib) in an event called the Hijra. This marks the
                establishment of the first Islamic state.</li>
            <li><strong>624 CE:</strong> The first major battle in Islamic history, known as the Battle of Badr, takes
                place. Despite being outnumbered, the Muslims achieve a decisive victory, which strengthens their
                position in
                Medina.</li>
            <li><strong>628 CE:</strong> Muhammad signs the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah with the Quraysh, allowing Muslims to
                perform the pilgrimage (known as Hajj) the following year. This treaty also leads to an increase in
                conversions to Islam.</li>
            <li><strong>630 CE:</strong> Muhammad and his followers conquer Mecca without bloodshed. He cleanses the
                Kaaba,
                the holiest site in Islam, from the idols and establishes it as the center of Islamic worship.</li>
            <li><strong>632 CE:</strong> In his final sermon, known as the Farewell Sermon, Muhammad delivers important
                guidance to the Muslim community. Shortly after, he falls ill and passes away in Medina. This event
                marks the
                end of his earthly life.</li>
